## Description ##
Software protocol stacks are highly heterogeneous and complex, often spanning layers starting from hardware at the bottom, then going through several low-level operating system (OS) layers written in C, and ending up with high-level libraries written in managed languages such as Java. In addition, they are also long-lived entities with lots of legacy code involved. Therefore, developing and maintaining a software protocol stack is a complex task with many parties and products involved over a long period of time. In the process, there are many issues that impede the developers’ productivity and stack reliability: (1) hardware fragmentation, (2) interaction with other features in a heterogeneous environment, (3) conformance to protocol specification or incomplete specification, (4) problems related to inherent asynchrony and concurrency, (5) real-time timing issues, (6) communication-related problems (overtaking, loss of messages, etc.).
