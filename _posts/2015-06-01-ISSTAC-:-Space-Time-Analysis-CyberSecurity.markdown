## Funding Agency ##
DARPA : Space-Time Analysis of CyberSecurity

## People ##
* [Corina Pasareanu][corina] (Principal Investigator) [NASA Ames / CMU]
* [Temesghen Kahsai][teme] (Co-Investigator) [NASA Ames / CMU]



## Description ## 

The Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC)
program seeks to enable analysts to identify algorithmic resource
usage vulnerabilities in software at levels of scale and speed great
enough to support a methodical search for them in the software upon
which the U.S. government, military, and economy depend. Proposed
research should investigate innovative approaches that enable
revolutionary advances in science, devices, or systems.

This is a collborative research between CMU, Vanderbilt University
(Prof. Karsai Gabor, Dr. Daniel Balasubramanian) and University of
California, Santa Barbar (Prof. Tefvik Bultan).
